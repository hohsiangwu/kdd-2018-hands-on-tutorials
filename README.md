# A Hands On Tutorial, With Applications of Sequence to Sequence Learning Using Keras

A [hands-on tutorial](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2018/hands-on-tutorials) for [KDD 2018](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2018/).

## Abstract
Chatbots, machine translation and agents that summarize text coherently may seem like science fiction or marketing-hype to even experienced machine learning practitioners. In this hands-on-tutorial, you will be guided through a real industry example of how sequence to sequence models are used to create data products. Machine learning engineers from Github will guide you through the process of collecting and preparing the data, building the model architecture and analyzing results. In this hands on session, we will go into greater depth regarding how the architecture was built, how it is used in practice and practical considerations with regards to using this model in a production environment. This will be an end to end example including a dataset that will be publicly hosted with all code made publicly available.

## Requirements
The target audience of this tutorial are moderately skilled users who have some familiarity with neural networks and are comfortable writing code. Attendees must bring a laptop and will be using free [gpu-enabled notebooks (with 12 hour runtime limit) from Google](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) - google chrome browser is required. Open source tools will be used, so no software licenses will be required.
- [Google colab url](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hohsiangwu/kdd-2018-hands-on-tutorials/blob/master/Feature%20Extraction%20and%20Summarization%20with%20Sequence%20to%20Sequence%20Learning.ipynb) for this tutorial


## Tutorial Outline
See this [notebook](https://github.com/hohsiangwu/kdd-2018-hands-on-tutorials/blob/master/Feature%20Extraction%20and%20Summarization%20with%20Sequence%20to%20Sequence%20Learning.ipynb). We will go in depth into (1) how these models are being used for product research at Github, (2) practical considerations with regards to using this model in a customer facing product and how to evaluate results both qualitatively and quantitatively, (3) related research we have conducted, (4) other tools and techniques that can be used to accomplish the same goals and (5) a live Q&A session.

## Other information
TThe tutorial's duration is 3 hours. Latest version of Google Chrome and access to the internet is required. We will cover setup during the tutorial which will only require the installation of 1-2 python packages.
